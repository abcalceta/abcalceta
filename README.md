# Hello! It's Frances! :sparkles: :sparkles: :sparkles:
I'm just an ordinary girl that Googles what I don't know! :relaxed: (That's how I was able to teach myself a lot of my hobbies!)
## Here are some fun facts about me:
* ### My name is Frances Calceta, and I love learning things!
  * My hobbies:
    * I like drawing! I'm still learning, though. :crayon:
    * I make games for game jams! 
    * I can do 3D stuff with Blender! Modelling, rigging, animation... but I'm no pro! 
    * I can't sing, but I like making music! :musical_note:
