# Hello! It's Frances! :sparkles: :sparkles: :sparkles:
I'm an enthusiastic fresh grad with lots of Googling skills! :relaxed: (That's how I was able to teach myself a lot of my hobbies!)
## Here are some fun facts about me:
* ### My name is Frances Calceta, and I love learning things!
* ### I just graduated recently, and I'm looking for work! :mortar_board: 
  * I graduated this 2021 from **UP Diliman**! :sunflower:
  * My skills include:
    * Game Dev with **Godot Game Engine** :video_game:
    * Web Dev with **Ruby on Rails** :computer:
    * I also know **HTML** and **CSS** (but I'm still in the process of learning Javascript) :sparkling_heart:
    * I actually graduated from BLIS so I can do some **library work** as well, if needed. :books:]
    * I took the Introductory to Intermediate Japanese courses while I was in college. It's been a few years, so I'm not too confident in my **beginner Japanese language skill**, but I can relearn it if I have to.
    * I also know a bit of **Esperanto** (a constructed international auxiliary language)
  * My hobbies:
    * I like drawing! I'm still learning, though. :crayon:
    * I make games for game jams! 
    * I can do 3D stuff with Blender! Modelling, rigging, animation... but I'm no pro! 
    * I can't sing, but I write songs, play the ukulele, and I know how to use LMMS to produce music! :musical_note:
